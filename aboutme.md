My name is Daniel and I'm currently working as an embedded systems engineer.
When I have free time I like to make my own personal projects to learn and discover new things.

### Why I'm writing this blog?

Two reasons:

1. **Learning myself**: Writing articles is very helpful to learn in depth the different topics because I'm constantly thinking of all the questions that may arise to the reader and I'm trying to find detailed information so none of those questions remains unanswered. The articles also serve as a record, so if in the future I don't remember something I can take a look at what I wrote.

2. **Helping others to learn**: Although in this blog some articles might get quite technical, I want begginers with a minimum base in programming to be able to follow and understand the topics. Nowadays I tend to find articles that are to elemental or instead to hard to understand because lots of assumptions are made, I'm not saying that none of those is bad, but I want my blog to be that piece that goes in the middle and allows intermediate readers to step from basic stuff to more complex and interesting challenges. Basically, I write here what I would have liked to read when I was learning myself. I'm not forggeting about more advanced users either, I want my blog to also serve as a resource library. A lot of time can be spent while searching information about a specific topic because the information is really spread out and sometimes it is not that clear what exactly to search for. Here you will find multiple references to related but more particular articles where I got the information, so hopefully I this saves you a couple of hours.

### Standing on the shoulders of giants
Nowadays lots of these giants live in Stack Overflow, Github or independent blogs. It's undeniable that there are and will be people smarter than us, but it is such a pleasure when those people take some of their time to share their knowledge and help others to learn.

You can see this blog as a summary of the best pages I was able to find seasoned with my own explanations and thoughs. You will be always able to find a reference to the source where I took the information.

Happy reading and programming!
